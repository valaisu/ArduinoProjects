Code for controlling a laser turret as a cat toy. 

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCymSWe7S34

Currently just moves around randomly. 

Improvement ideas: 
- [ ] Add a remote control to easily define the playing area
- [ ] Add a camera for tracking the cat and running away form it

LASERS CAN BE DAMAGING TO EYES, IF YOU REPLICATE THIS MAKE SURE TO DIFFRACT THE LASER
