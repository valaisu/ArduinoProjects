The snake game for arduino. Controlled by 2 buttons. 

Parts required: 
* TFT 1.8 LCD display (or similar)
* Arduino
* 2 resistors
* 2 buttons
* Connection base and wires

The program file contains the information about how to connect the parts if you want to build one for yourself :)

On Arduino nano the memory usage is 11854 (38%) storage, 210 dynamic (10%). Runs on a 9V battery.

The project has been tested with Arduino Uno R3 and Arduino Nano.

I have soldered all the parts together, I will add a youtube demo once I am done 3D printing the case.
